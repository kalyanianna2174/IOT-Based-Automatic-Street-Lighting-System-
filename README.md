I gained the practical knowledge on the IOT components, and how to code in Arduino IDE software using C++ language.

**Abstract:**

The IoT-Based Automated Street Lighting System presented in this paper addresses the inefficiencies and challenges of traditional urban lighting infrastructure by leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technology.This paper presents automatic street lighting system using Arduino microcontroller technology integrated with IR (Infrared) and LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensors. The system aims to enhance energy efficiency and provide responsive illumination by autonomously controlling street lights based on environmental conditions. The IR sensor detects motion, triggering the system to activate the street lights, while the LDR sensor measures ambient light levels to ensure lights are only activated in darkness. The implementation is validated through hardware integration and programming in the Arduino IDE, demonstrating real-time sensor data acquisition, decision- making logic, and reliable control of the street lights. This project underscores the feasibility and practicality of IoT applications in urban infrastructure, offering potential scalability and adaptation in smart city initiatives for sustainable urban development.
